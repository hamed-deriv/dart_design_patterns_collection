## [Mediator Pattern](lib/mediator/mediator.dart)

The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that helps to reduce the dependencies between the objects in a system by introducing a mediator object that acts as a communication hub between the objects. In this pattern, the objects don't communicate with each other directly, but instead, they communicate through the mediator. This helps to improve the maintainability and scalability of the system.

## [Observer Pattern](lib/observer/observer.dart)

The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that is used to establish a one-to-many relationship between objects. In this pattern, an object (the subject) maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them automatically when any changes to its state occur. The Observer pattern is useful when you have a complex system with many objects that need to stay updated with the state changes of one or more objects.

## [Singleton Pattern](lib/singleton/singleton.dart)

The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
