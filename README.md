## [Mediator Pattern](lib/mediator.dart)

The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that helps to reduce the dependencies between the objects in a system by introducing a mediator object that acts as a communication hub between the objects. In this pattern, the objects don't communicate with each other directly, but instead, they communicate through the mediator. This helps to improve the maintainability and scalability of the system.
